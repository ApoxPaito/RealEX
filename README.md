# RealEX
A very incomplete attempt of mine using Rastertek's (https://rastertek.com/) tutorials to come up with a 3D engine, not promising the code here is up-to-date with what I have come up with so far (don't take it as a promise of me having a better working engine on hand too though)

## So how does it work?
You should be able to compile the project outright and see how it works. Right now the only thing you can do is to move in the terrain with WASD and Page Up/Down and pan the camera with the Arrow Keys.
...and that's only thing it is good for so far, I was implementing a Terrain LOD but it's pretty incomplete, so I kinda disabled it here and made everything render in High quality.

The layout of the engine is pretty much one-to-one with Raster's code, save for a few updates in DirectX API and my usage of FMOD instead of DirectSound.

### Disclaimer
I do not own the resources used for 3D models, textures and sounds in this project, given that I have *borrowed* them from Raster's website and Mount&Blade: Warband which belongs to Taleworlds Entertainment.
Especially I do not own FMOD API, FMOD API is owned Firelight Technologies Pty Ltd.

The one thing I can say I certainly own is the music playing in the background though. ~~It is an as-original-it-gets composition of mine~~
